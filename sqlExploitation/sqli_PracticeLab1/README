Welcome to the SQLI Testing Environment

This application is intended to provide an offline environment for people interested in hacking/pentesting to test their skills. A basic challenge has been set for each page just to give you something to aim for. This is by no means the only possible target and others may be added in the future.

What this application will do:
-Provide you with an environment to practice SQL Injection
-Expose you to some of the stranger forms of SQL Injection (eg cookies, server variables etc)

What this application WON'T do:
-Walk you through the challenges


Setup instructions:
Before doing anything you will need to have a web server and a mysql database setup. 
I recommend one of the free, all in one solutions (xampp, lamp, mamp, wamp etc).
Check out the repository (or download the zip on the right) and copy all files into your web root (usually htdocs)
Then just navigate to http://<youriphere>:<port>/index.php

Before you start hacking away you will need to setup the database. Simply select the "Setup" link on the index page and enter the required details.

Happy hacking
