					<h2>About Simulation</h2>
					<p>This testing environment has been built to help you understand SQL injections. Code structure has been kept as basic as possible 
                    to make it possible for anyone to edit source. This script is still under development and your suggestion/collaboration to improve it 
                    is welcome. Please use the contact form on <a href="<?php echo URL; ?>" target="_blank">our website</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h2 style="padding-top:30px;">About <?php echo DISPLAY_URL; ?></h2>
                    <p> This website was developed to provide information about SQL injection to students, IT professionals and computer security enthusiasts. 
                    Without having the pretention to cover every aspect of the topic in depth, it intends to be a quick reference for developers and great 
                    source of information for anyone who might be concern or interested to this security flaw. Our goal is to provide information about 
                    SQL injection so that people involved in software development and maintenance can make informed decision about data security.</p>
                    
                    <p>SQL injection flaws are present everywhere and they are frequently overlooked, sometimes ignored, even by highly qualified IT 
                    professionals. The lack of information about this topic has created a great space for this site to be created. In fact, the majority 
                    of documentation about SQL injection is really limited in depth because it is exclusively dedicated to beginners. Other documents 
                    are highly technical and are addressed to security consultants and/or hackers. This website tries to be a bridge between these two 
                    worlds by teaching basic guide lines and progressively moving to advanced techniques.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some general computer security topics are also introduced in our articles since they apply to SQL injection problems and 
                    solutions. However, they are not extensively covered because the website focuses on SQL security flaws and covering general 
                    computer security principles would be out of the topic.</p>
