					<h2>Instructions</h2>
					<p>All simulation cases are listed in the "Simulations" section. Generally speaking, easier simulations 
                    are at the beggining. Select your simulation by clicking on the link at the end of the simulation you 
                    want to try.</p><br />

                    <h4>#1 - The Simulation Case</h4>
                    <p>When you enter the simulation, you have the main page on the left. It is the vulnerable script.
                    It immitates a script that could be found on a website (login, search, etc.).</p>
                    
                    <h4>#2 - Page Purpose</h4>
                    <p>On the right there is an information pannel. It contains information about the page purpose. The goal of this 
                    section is only to explain the context or the purpose of the page to the tester.</p>
                    
                    <h4>#3 - Goal</h4>
                    <p>Gives a small hint about what the tester could attempt to do if he/she is not familiar with SQL injection attacks.</p>
                    
                    <h4>#4 - Parameter</h4>
                    <p>Provide more information about the parameter(s) passed to the PHP script to generate the query. 
                    This is mainly for people who are not familiar with web development (GET/POST parameters).</p>
