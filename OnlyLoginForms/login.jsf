<p><strong>What is the Variable Energy Surcharge?</strong><br />
Rising energy prices have significantly increased our operating costs. To continue providing you with high quality products and excellent service, an energy surcharge will be applied to future invoices.

The surcharge will appear as a separate line item on each invoice, starting with your next statement. We reserve the right to apply the surcharge in our sole discretion. Please note that we do not establish the Monthly U.S. Average On-Road Diesel Price. To learn more about recent energy price developments, please contact the Department of Energy at (202) 586-6966 or go to the <a href>"http://www.doe.gov/engine/content.do" target="_blank"> U.S. Department of Energy website</a>.

</p> 
</div>

<div id="addressdifferences" style="display:none;" title="Address differences">

<div id="refundablebottledeposit" style="display:none;" title="Refundable water bottle deposits">
<p><strong>What is a Refundable Water Bottle Deposit?</strong><br />
A water bottle deposit is a fee charged for every 3 or 5-gallon bottle delivered to you. A bottle deposit is refundable and will be credited to your account once each empty bottle is returned. If you return more bottles than were delivered to you, then a bottle deposit credit is applied to your account. For example, if you received four full bottles and returned five empty bottles during your billing period, you will receive a bottle deposit credit for one bottle. A bottle deposit charge may appear on your invoice if more bottles were delivered to you than were returned to your delivery person. For example, if you received five full bottles and returned only four empty bottles during your billing period, you will receive a refundable bottle deposit charge. Remember, your invoice will only reflect the activity that occurred during the billing period.

</div>

<div id="recycle" style="display:none;" title="Recycling big bottles">
<p><strong>Do you recycle your big water bottles?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! We are dedicated to using the highest quality, most cost effective and most environmentally responsible  bottled water containers possible. Our 3 and 5 gallon bottles are cleaned, sanitized and refilled 40 to 50 times. Most of our big water bottles are recycled at the end of their life-cycle. The recycled plastic is used to make carpet, toys, tool handles, bird feeders and other items. For these reasons, you won't typically find large bottled water containers in landfills.</p>
</div>

<div id="recyclingoptions" style="display:none;" title="Recycling options">
<p><strong>What are the recycling options for single-serve water bottles?</strong></p>

</div>

<div id="shelflife" style="display:none;" title="Shelf-life of a bottle of water">
<p><strong>How long is the shelf-life of a bottle of water?</strong></p>
<p>Our bottles indicate a &quot;best by&quot; date. While bottled water is not a perishable food product, we recommend rotating your emergency supply and storing it under optimum conditions. Bottled water should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and high temperatures. Bottled water should be stored away from paints, solvents, garden chemicals, cleaning compounds and petroleum products, such as gasoline.</p>
</div>

<div id="emergencyprep" style="display:none;" title="Emergency water bottle types">
<p><strong>What type of bottled water containers should I store for emergency preparedness?</strong></p>
<p>We recommend our 8-ounce, 16-ounce and 24-ounce single-serve bottles and 1- and 2.5-gallon containers. These smaller containers are typically easier to handle and store.</p>
</div>

<div id="rotatebottles" style="display:none;" title="Rotating the water bottles">

<p>We recommend rotating and replacing your supply every six months.</p>

</div>

<div id="nowater" style="display:none;" title="Water isn't coming out of my dispenser">
<p><strong>Why isn't water coming out of my dispenser?</strong></p>
<p>The thermostat may be set too low and the water is frozen. To fix the situation follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unplug your dispenser.</li>
<li>Turn the dispenser around and locate the thermostat. In most models, the thermostat is about 2 feet above the bottom of the dispenser and is attached to the metal grate along the back of the dispenser.</li>
<li>Using a small standard screwdriver, turn the screw no more than a quarter of a turn to the left (counter clockwise) to raise the temperature.</li>
<li>Plug the dispenser back in, allow the water to readjust to the new setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the problem persists, please notify <a href="/contact-us.jsf" target="_blank">Customer Service </a>immediately by clicking on the "Contact Customer Service" link at the bottom of the homepage. We will reply to your request within two business days to schedule a time when your delivery person  can correct the problem.
</p>
</div>

<div id="noroomtemp" style="display:none;" title="No room temperature water dispensing">
<p><strong>What should I do if my dispenser should have cold and room temperature water, but both are cold?</strong></p>
<p>The room temperature (cook) and cold dispenser has two distinct reservoirs that hold water at two different temperatures one at room temperature for cooking purposes, and the other chilled to about 45-50 degrees. Leading to each reservoir are two lines that hold about 12 ounces of water. In some cases, the cold line may accidentally chill the room temperature line, resulting in cold water coming from both spigots. Once the 12 ounces of water from both lines are released, room temperature water will dispense directly from the reservoir.</p>
</div>

<div id="boilingwater" style="display:none;" title="Boiling water inside my dispenser bottle">
<p><strong>Why is water boiling inside the bottle on my dispenser?</strong></p>
<p>While this happens infrequently and is not dangerous, it can be surprising to see. When an air pocket forms in the reservoir of a hot and cold dispenser, the heating element is exposed and creates enough heat to boil the water in the bottle above. If this happens, simply unplug the dispenser and dispense water from the spigots. This will release the air pocket. After the dispenser has been plugged in again, the water will be heated in the reservoir at the appropriate temperature.</p>
</div>

<div id="hotwater" style="display:none;" title="Hot water temperature">
<p><strong>How hot will the hot water from the dispenser be?</strong></p>
<p>In a hot and cold dispenser, the temperature of the hot water is between 170 and 190 degrees. IT SHOULD BE DISPENSED WITH CAUTION AND KEPT OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. If you are interested in receiving safety spigots, please speak with your delivery person, email Customer Service or contact Customer Service at 1-800-728-5508. We will respond to you within two business days.</p>
</div>

<div id="leaking" style="display:none;" title="Leaking dispenser or water bottle">
<p><strong>What should I do if my dispenser or water bottle are leaking?</strong></p>
<p>Email <a href="/contact-us.jsf" target="_blank">Customer Service </a> immediately or call Customer Service at 1-800-728-5508. We will schedule a time to come out and evaluate your situation. </p>
<br/>
<p>Until we are able to determine the source of the leak, there are a few steps you can take to prevent more water from leaking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the water bottle and drain the remaining water out of the bottle on the dispenser by releasing it through the spigots.</li>
  <li>Once you remove the bottle from the dispenser, look inside the reservoir. If there is a full reservoir of water, and the   dispenser is no longer leaking, the bottle was the source of the leak, not the dispenser.</li>
<li>Let your delivery person know that the bottle had a leak and we will replace the bottle of water at no charge to you.</li>
<li>If the dispenser continues to leak once the bottle has been removed, continue to drain the dispenser through the spigots, until all remaining water has been drained out of the dispenser.</li>
</div>

<li>Ensure that the water bottle dust cover flap on top of spill-proof cap is removed before placing onto the cooler's spill-proof probe</li>
<li>Never place any paper, objects, or liquids (other than bottled water) into your empty water bottles or cooler&#47;dispenser</li>
