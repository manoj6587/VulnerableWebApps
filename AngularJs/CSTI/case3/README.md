#AngularJS Google Search Example#
See (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28505183/google-like-search-box-with-an-angularjs-directive/)

This demonstrates a basic search example which has a main application controller, and a page controller.
Both share a service called SearchService which handles the current search type/state, and the search function.

This also demonstrates the ability to switch between "Tabs" that is, switching between a web or image search.
